FusionTable-Map-2-layers
========================

NOT YET WORKING Search-and-Filter Map (with 2 layers: points and polygons) that draws data from Google Fusion Tables, based on template by Derek Eder

attempting to draw one or both polygon layers (these are just placeholders; nothing special)
  polygon1TableID:    "1ceippR4giBiF-pT9PE1YAUvebFp6_NKvYriccYo", //CT town boundaries
  polygon2TableID:    "1VopQGBhRKyyk25EIA5ptScvULxR68d43RhZ1ycM", //Hartford area school districts by race
