Search-and-Filter Map (with 2 layers: points and polygons) that draws data from Google Fusion Tables, based on template by Derek Eder http://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/

Use this Google Fusion Tables template if you wish to create a 2-layer map (both points and polygons), where you can turn individual layers on/off, and search-and-filter results. Also, the point map includes a textual legend (A, B, C) rather than a numeric one. 

Basic steps:

1) Make your own copy of this template: either Fork to your own GitHub account, or Clone in Desktop, or Download a ZIP compressed version to your desktop.

2) Modify two files, following instructions in the code comments:

- index.html
- maps_lib.js (located inside the js folder)

3) Host everything on the web (such as a GitHub repository gh-pages branch)
